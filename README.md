# Optimizer_App
It is an App made with Flet,pulp,knapsacl .etc libraries for solving optimization problems with two variables.
Initially I had wanted to make an app which can run on mobile phones So i had chosen flet but I could not find a way to convert it into an .apk or .ipa  If someone will be able to it would be great . It Solves Simplex -min/max ,Knapsack fractional-min/max,knapsack binary -min/max ,Branch and Bound -min/max questions .
On the Top left there is a Pop-up button which has a list of example questions to Show the user the forma t in which he ahs to enter the questions in order to get the answers .

IT WILL BE REALLY GREAT IF WE ARE ABLE TO CONVERT IT INTO AN ACTUAL MOBILE APP .
